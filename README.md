The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient implementation of the BigInteger abstract data type (ADT) in C++. The aim is to create a new class that represents arbitrarily large integers, using a list of longs to store the magnitude of the number and an integer to represent its sign. The implementation will be based on the algorithms used for long arithmetic, ensuring that the resulting BigInteger class is both accurate and efficient. This implementation will be designed with a focus on performance, robustness, and maintainability, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of applications.
